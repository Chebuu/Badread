# Badread

Badread is a long read simulator tool that makes - you guessed it - bad reads! By that I mean it can imitate many kinds of problems one might encounter in real read sets: chimeric reads, glitchy regions, systematic errors and more. You can use it to generate realistic read sets (with a normal amount of problems) or truly terrible read sets with way too many problems. I made Badread for the purposes of testing long read assemblers. With it, one can see how different types of read problems affect assembly quality.
