Badread is a long read simulator tool that makes – you guessed it – bad reads! It can imitate many kinds of problems one might encounter in real read sets: chimeric reads, low-quality regions, systematic basecalling errors and more. You can use Badread to generate a realistic read set (with a normal amount of problems) or turn up the problems for a truly terrible read set. I made it for the purposes of testing long read assemblers. With it, one can see how different types of read problems affect assembly quality.
